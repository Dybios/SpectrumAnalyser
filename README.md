# Spectrum Analyser
Credit where credit is due, this is a real-time spectrum analyzer created in Python (3.x) completely using Gemini prompts and iterations. This was created with an intention for a personal need for having audio monitor of sorts.

To use it directly, just download and run the ```SpectrumAnalyzer.exe``` file from the latest release [here](https://github.com/Dybios/SpectrumAnalyser/releases/tag/v1). Once opened, it should look like this.

To run the code in Python, you will need to install the following dependencies.

``pip install numpy matplotlib pyaudio scipy pyi-splash``

Then you will be able to directly run the code with the following command.

``python spectrumAnalyser.py``

Feel free to use this piece of code however you like.
